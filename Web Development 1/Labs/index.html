    <h1>Travelling: A hobby</h1>
    <p>Travelling is one of the few activities that have a kind of reset button in our lives.
         You go away for a few days or weeks and come back fresh and ready to take on the challenges 
         of life head-on. Travelling helps us <strong>ignite our creativity, find the meaning of life, and 
         appreciate beauty in its most supreme form.</strong> It mainly involves exploring new places, cultures, 
         and activities for personal growth, relaxation, and adventure.</p>

    <h2>Journey through the mountains</h2>
    <p>Traveling to the mountains gives you the chance to see some of the most beautiful and peaceful views
       on Earth. The tall snow-covered peaks look amazing against the blue sky, and the valleys below are full 
       of green forests and rivers. You can escape from the stress of everyday life. The calm and quiet in the 
       <em>mountains help you relax</em> and forget about all the busy things you do at home or school. The peaceful 
       atmosphere in the mountains makes it easy to take a break and focus on feeling calm. On a mountain trip, 
       you can enjoy the sounds of nature, like birds singing or the wind blowing through the trees. These natural
       sounds can help you forget about your worries.</p>
